PhDagentSpring2026/moodle/task3.1/visual_expert.html

this version looks promising but I expect sth that shows the interrelationship among different modules of the paper not just a linear and hierarhichal presentation

we need to see how different parts are interconnected; I also want to see some texts from each modules and explore links among these texts

please generate a new visual_interconnection_text_expert.html
