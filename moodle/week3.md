in week 3 I'll meet with 7 students (1 in sick leave); but the other 5 students do not need to come; but they are invited to complete some tasks
in other words we are doing flipped classroom

the course materials can be found in the PDFs via the link here (Google drive folder) and a folder here PhDagentSpring2026/Materials/studentPDFs - a total of 7 sessions; we'll cover all of them but we'll do so while engaging AI agent

task 1 is to ensure students can set up a GitHub repo and do some basic analysis

the repo can be found here https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026/ 

each student is invited to fork it; I think they have already done so

then they should invite me to edit their repo
they should make their repo private but invite me (tesolchina) to edit

so this is a Moodle post; I hope everybody can do this asap

they can always pull latest changes from the repo

then we need to do a task using the AI agent

let's review the macro level structure of a paper and visualize it

this echo the issue in session 1 of the course materials

so our input is a published research paper in a machine readable format
then we focus on the headings and sub-headings of the paper
we send the paper to AI agent and ask for a Mermaid style visualization in html format that can be shared in Moodle forum (note that Moodle forum can only support basic html format)

consider PhDagentSpring2026/moodle/task3.1 
the first round of input, process and output can be found here PhDagentSpring2026/moodle/task3.1/visualizeMacro.md 
then the output is PhDagentSpring2026/moodle/task3.1/visual.html

we use this output as input and provide some comments here PhDagentSpring2026/moodle/task3.1/commentonVisual.md
then we get PhDagentSpring2026/moodle/task3.1/visual_interconnection_text.html 


so we expect each student to pick a different paper to generate some output in html or Mermaid codes to visualize the overall structure of a paper and how different parts interconnect 

you may reply with a link to the folder in your GitHub repo (which can be private- but accessible to Simon: tesolchina)
