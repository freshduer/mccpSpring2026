Best practices for using AI
Check for Bias and Accuracy: Always review and verify AI-generated content before sharing it with students.
The 80-20 Approach: Use AI for the initial 80% of the work, but ensure you refine, adapt, and add your final touches for the last 20%.
Understand AI's Limits: AI's knowledge may not include the latest information. Verify recent topics for accuracy. And use your own source materials as much as you can.
Protect Privacy: Never include personal student information when using AI.
Be Specific: The more detailed your input, the better the output. Provide clear instructions to get the best results.
