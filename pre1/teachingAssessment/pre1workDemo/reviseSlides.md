consider the slides generated as well as materials on the presentation mccpSpring2026/pre1/materials especially mccpSpring2026/pre1/materials/pre1AssessmentRubrics.md


create a slidesV2.html to address the following issues 
- the slide is too wide on a 16:9 screen; we need more margin on both sides 
- the slide contents are not enough to speak for 8 minutes
- we need slide no on each slide 
- more labelling making reference to the assessment instructions nad rubrics 
- more transitional cues across slides 
- also we want to the html to be editable on browser (changes can be saved in cache and downloaded as a new html file)
