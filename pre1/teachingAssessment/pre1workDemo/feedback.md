# Feedback on AI-Generated Outline

## Instructions

After the AI agent generates your presentation outline (via `genOutline.md`), review it carefully and provide your feedback below. Be as specific as possible — the AI will use your feedback to revise the outline and generate your HTML slides.


check the pptx files in mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1workDemo/sample_slides
and turn them into md file and also create a style.md to describe their styles and formats that can be recaptured in html 

the outline generated is fine - take a look at materials in mccpSpring2026/writing and create an updatedOutline.md to strengthen the part on learning about writing 

create updated_slide_plan.md based on mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1workDemo/slide_plan.md, updatedOutline.md and style.md 

then based on the updated_slide_plan.md, updatedOutline.md, mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1workDemo/papers/KV_flow_paper_full.html to create slides4pre1demo.html 

commit and push all changes to github 

publish the html to github pages and return a URL link for public access
