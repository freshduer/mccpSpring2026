# Feedback on AI-Generated Outline

The outline is good, but I only need about 9 slides. I want to ensure the presentation is accessible for people with no prior training on this topic.

## Instructions

After the AI agent generates your presentation outline (via `genOutline.md`), review it carefully and provide your feedback below. Be as specific as possible — the AI will use your feedback to revise the outline and generate your HTML slides.

## Overall Impression

<!-- Rate the overall quality of the generated outline (1-5 stars) and explain briefly -->

Rating: **4**/5

Comments: The outline accurately reflects the paper and matches the assessment requirements. I’d like it revised to use exactly about 9 slides and to strengthen accessibility for a non-specialist audience (no prior training on EAP or language teaching).

## Content Accuracy

<!-- Is the outline accurate to your paper? Are there any misinterpretations or missing points? -->

- [x] The introduction accurately represents the paper's topic and context
- [x] The key findings are correctly summarized
- [x] The significance section captures the real importance of the research
- [x] The "impact on my research" section makes sense for my situation

Issues or corrections: None. Content is accurate. If you add more “impact on my research” or “writing strategies” details later, I can update this.

## Accessibility for Non-Specialists

<!-- Would a non-specialist audience understand the outline as written? -->

- [x] Technical terms are adequately explained or avoided
- [x] Metaphors/examples are appropriate and helpful
- [x] The content is engaging for a general audience

Suggestions:
- Keep explaining “collocations” with everyday examples (e.g. “word pairs that often go together,” “phrases that sound natural”).
- Avoid or briefly gloss acronyms: EAP → “English for Academic Purposes (academic English teaching)”; TBLT only if needed, then “task-based teaching.”
- In the findings section, prefer plain language: e.g. “students who chatted freely with AI” vs “unguided group”; “students who followed step-by-step tasks” vs “guided group.”
- Add one short analogy if helpful (e.g. guided vs unguided like “following a recipe” vs “experimenting in the kitchen”).

## Structure and Flow

<!-- Is the presentation well-organized? Does it flow logically? -->

- [x] The opening hook is engaging
- [x] Transitions between sections are smooth
- [x] The timing allocation across sections seems right
- [x] The closing is effective

Suggestions: No change to structure. When revising to 9 slides, keep the same section order (Opening → Introduction → Key Findings → Significance → Impact on My Research → Closing).

## Visual Aid Preferences

<!-- What specific visuals do you want on your slides? -->

- **Preferred color scheme/style:** Clean and modern; 2–3 colours plus neutrals; high contrast for readability (e.g. dark text on light background). Accessible for different viewers.
- **Specific diagrams or charts to include:** One simple diagram comparing the three groups (Guided / Unguided / No AI). One chart or table for the main finding (e.g. unguided > guided > control in frequency/accuracy). Minimal text on the chart.
- **Key quotes from the paper to highlight:** Optional — e.g. one short line from the abstract or conclusion (e.g. “task design and learner engagement” or “unguided interaction … linked to more frequent and accurate use”).
- **Any images or visuals you want:** Simple icons for “guided,” “unguided,” and “control” if it helps; no clip art. Prefer simple shapes or a single clear figure.
- **Other design preferences:** Large font (e.g. 24pt+ body), plenty of white space, one main idea per slide. Align with `sample_slides/lessons4slides.md` principles.

## Specific Changes Requested

<!-- List any specific changes you want the AI to make -->

1. **Reduce to 9 slides.** Adjust the slide plan so there are exactly about 9 slides (e.g. merge “Research Design” into “What This Study Is About,” or combine the two “Key Finding” slides into one with a single clear chart).
2. **Strengthen accessibility.** In both the outline and the slide plan, ensure every technical term is either avoided or explained in one short phrase; add one or two concrete examples or analogies for “collocations” and “guided vs unguided.”
3. **Update slide_plan.md.** After the above changes, regenerate `slide_plan.md` with the 9-slide structure and any accessibility notes (e.g. “explain on slide” or “use plain language”) so the HTML slides can be built from it.

## Additional Notes

<!-- Anything else the AI should know when revising -->

- When generating HTML slides, use the revised 9-slide plan and keep text on each slide minimal so the talk remains accessible and easy to follow for non-specialists.
- Presenter notes in the outline can stay as they are; no need to translate the Chinese notes if the spoken presentation is in English.
