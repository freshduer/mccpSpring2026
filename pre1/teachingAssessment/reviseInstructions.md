revise the html file and create a new pre1instructions01.html 

```
Moodle forum has got restrictions on what codes are allowed; some color background cannot be seen 

students have already forked https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026 
just need to ask them to pull latest changes using AI agent 

paper they select has to be html, md or latex formats; pdfs have to be converted to md first 

review mccpSpring2026/pre1/materials/cursor_cloning_mccpspring2026_repositor.md more carefully and read the file paths and visit the files to better understand what I did 

students need to update their own files and send file paths to the AI agent to read and execute the instructions 

there are more files involved 
study mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1workDemo so you understand what students need to do 
then provide instructions for students to work on 
mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1work

there are some interim files to be generated 
refer to study mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1workDemo
